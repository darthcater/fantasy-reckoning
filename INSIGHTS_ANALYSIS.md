### 💭 INTERESTING BUT LOWER PRIORITY

#### Manager Personality Insights (Could be a 6th card: "The Mirror")
- **Patience vs. impatience score** - How long you hold underperformers
- **Market timing grade** - Buy high/low patterns
- **Meta exploitation index** - Blocking opponents strategically
- **Rivalry performance** - Head-to-head vs. specific managers

**Argument for 6th Card "The Mirror"**:
These personality/behavioral insights don't fit cleanly into existing cards but would create a fascinating psychological profile. However, risk diluting impact of 5 focused cards.

#### Depth/Injury Management (Limited by Yahoo Data)
- **Depth insurance grade** - Forced to start weak players
- **Bye week planning score** - Mitigation quality
- **Fragility tax** - Injury impact quantification
- **Resilience index** - Winning despite injuries

**Why lower priority**: Requires injury designation data that Yahoo may not reliably provide historically.

#### What-If Simulations (Computationally Expensive)
- **"All-in on projections" what-if**
- **"No moves" universe**
- **"Perfect waivers" universe**
- **Alternative draft path**

**Why lower priority**: Very cool but computationally heavy; marginal value vs. implementation cost.

### ❌ RULED OUT / NOT FEASIBLE

#### Requires Data We Don't Have
- **Opponent-aware decisions** - Requires knowing user's strategic intent
- **Flex utilization profile** - Yahoo doesn't distinguish flex clearly in all formats
- **Streaming edge score** - Requires position-by-position streaming identification
- **Innovative strategy index** - Too subjective, hard to quantify

#### Out of Scope
- **League-wide comparative insights** - Our MVP is per-manager cards, not league dashboards
- **Trade behavior** (most insights) - Yahoo trade data is inconsistent/incomplete in historical pulls

## RECOMMENDATION: Strategic Card Enhancement

### Option A: Keep 5 Cards, Enhance Quality ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Add to existing cards:**
- Card 1 (+1): "Walked past gold" index
- Card 2 (+1): Upside vs. floor tendency
- Card 3 (+2): Trade regret spotlight, Emergency hero moments
- Card 4 (+2): Waiver efficiency rate, Time-to-adoption
- Card 5 (+2): Ran into a buzzsaw, Killer weeks

**Result**: 8 new insights, ~34% increase in depth, maintains tight narrative focus

### Option B: Add 6th Card "The Mirror" (Manager Psychology)
**New card focused on personality/behavior:**
- Risk profile (already have, expand)
- Patience score (hold times)
- Market timing (breakout capture speed)
- Clutch performance
- Rivalry performance

**Trade-off**: More content but risks diluting focus; harder to design; may overwhelm users

## Arguments for Top 3 Must-Have Additions

### 1. "Walked past gold" index (Card 1) 🥇
**The Reckoning Statement**: "Three times you could have drafted Jahmyr Gibbs. Three times you chose... someone else."

**Why essential**:
- Perfect hindsight regret fuel
- Quantifiable with exact data we have
- Fits Draft Tribunal judgment theme perfectly
- Creates viral "I can't believe I passed on X" moments

**Implementation**: Moderate - need to track draft pick availability windows

### 2. Waiver efficiency rate (Card 4) 🥈
**The Reckoning Statement**: "You made 15 waiver moves. Only 4 ever started. The rest? Noise."

**Why essential**:
- Separates smart from desperate management
- Validates active managers OR exposes churn addiction
- High viral potential ("My efficiency was 80%!")
- Data we definitely have

**Implementation**: Easy - transaction data + weekly rosters

### 3. "Ran into a buzzsaw" + Killer weeks (Card 5) 🥉
**The Reckoning Statement**: "Week 7: You dropped 168 points. Your opponent dropped 172. The ledger shows no mercy."

**Why essential**:
- Explains bad luck with sympathy
- Pairs perfectly with "killer weeks" for balance
- Creates memorable narrative moments
- Makes losing feel less painful (you weren't bad, just unlucky)

**Implementation**: Trivial - simple weekly scoring comparisons

## Final Verdict

**Stay with 5 cards**, but enhance each with 1-2 carefully chosen insights from the list above. Prioritize:
1. Insights that create strong emotional reactions (regret, vindication, sympathy)
2. Insights feasible with our current Yahoo data
3. Insights that fit naturally into existing card narratives

**The Reckoning's power is its focus and drama, not comprehensive stats overload.**
