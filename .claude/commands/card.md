description: Edit a specific card's generation code
argument-hint: [card number 1-4]
---

Focus on Card $1 generation code.

Card mapping:
- Card 1: "The Leader" - archetype, skill percentiles, overall percentile
- Card 2: "The Ledger" - your balance, key moves table
- Card 3: "The Lineup" - deployment stats, pivotal moment
- Card 4: "The Legend" - true skill record, luck factors, agent of chaos

Read the relevant `generate_card_$1` function in both:
- `html_generator.py` (league pages)
- `generate_homepage.py` (homepage preview)

Then wait for instructions on what to change.
